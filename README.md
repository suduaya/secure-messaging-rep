# Secure Messaging Repository System ![alt text](https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/mail-1-basic/512/17-Locked_Mail-512.png)

'The objective of this project is to develop a system enabling users to exchange messages asynchronously. Messages are sent and received through a non-trustworthy central repository, which keeps messages for users until they fetch them. The resulting system is composed by a Rendezvous Point, or Server, and several clients exchanging messages. The system should be designed to support the following security features:

• Message confidentiality, integrity and authentication: Messages cannot be
eavesdropped, modified or injected by a third party or the server;

• Message delivery confirmation: message readers should be able to prove that they have had access to their contents (i.e. have read them);

• Identity preservation: There is a direct association between one user and one Portuguese Citizen, and vice-versa, using the Portuguese Citizen Card.'
